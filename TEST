        basically what we want is a arrythimia simulator 
        --
        to go into training mode wifi must be connected PROMPT TO CONNECT 
        --
        In training mode
        when both pads are connected we receive 1 and we display graph assosciated with it
        else we display blank video
        if wifi not connected we prompt to connect to wifi

        --
        in presentation mode
        we allow professor to play the video and show their students the video
        --
        in graph selection
        the cards should show a video player that that can be viewed if needed with title
        --
         wifi sends  0 and 1 
         1 means both pads engaged 
         0 means otherwise
         no response means wifi not connected
